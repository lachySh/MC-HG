Note: This is a fork of Spigot plugin YAGHGP, which I am using as the basis of a personal project. Trying to recreate the MCPVP 2011-2013 era type of hunger games mode :)

# MC-HG - Golden Era Hunger Games

This plugin hosts a randomly generated world as a hunger games game (WIP)

## What is MC-HG?
MC-HG was a gamemode hosted by MCPVP which peaked in popularity back in 2011-2013. Back then, 120 player servers would be filled up in a matter of minutes to play this gamemode.
There's not much of this scene left, but I look back fondly on this era of Minecraft, which is why I decided to make a plugin which emulates (and improves upon) what was done back then.

### Development roadmap:
 * [x] Basic functionality for hosting a randomly generated world-type hunger games game
 * [x] Soup PvP
 * [x] Soup custom crafting recipes
 * [x] Better UI for lobby
 * [x] Lobby voting between random map and pre-made map selections
 * [ ] Feasts
 * [ ] Kits
 * [ ] Allow users to join during a game in progress and be sent to lobby, with option to spectate
 * [ ] Better UI for in-game (?)
